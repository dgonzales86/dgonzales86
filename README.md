Hello, I’m Donald Gonzales, BSCS.

I am passionate about creating software, robotics, and working on my farm. Professionally, I work as a software programmer, specializing in developing stored procedures in MS SQL Server and web applications in C# using the .NET framework.

Currently, I am developing a farm management application designed to manage and track farm operations. I will be uploading an SQL file containing the current database schema. Please note that as the application is still in the planning phase, the database structure may change over time.
