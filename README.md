I build durable, ethical systems that solve real problems in the real world. I value clarity over complexity, judgment over credentials, and long-term sustainability over short-term wins. I design software and workflows that respect people, time, and constraints—especially in regulated or high-stakes environments. I choose work that compounds: skills, trust, autonomy, and impact. I’m willing to move slower, say no to misaligned money, and resist hype if it preserves mission, quality, and long-term leverage.
