- Hi, I’m Donald Gonzales, BSCS
- My passions are creating software, robotics, and developing my farm. I'm attempting to transition from an ER registered nurse to a career in software development.
- Currently, I have been working on the development of a farm management application. This application will help manage and keep track of farm operations.
- I will upload an SQL file with the current database. As the application is still in its planning phase, the database may change over time.
